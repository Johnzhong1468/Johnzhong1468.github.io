Hello world!

My name is John Zhong and I am a Master student studying Financial Engineering at Cornell University. <br>
I am interested in the financial market, especially interested in the field of quantitative finance. <br>
I am also an active athlete. I was a coxswain for the UCSB Men's Rowing team and now I am coxing for New York Athletic Club. <br>
